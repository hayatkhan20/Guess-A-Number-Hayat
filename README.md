# Guess-A-Number-Hayat

# Description:
The "Guess the Number" game is an interactive and entertaining challenge where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The objective is to refine their numerical intuition and deduction skills. As players submit their guesses, the game provides feedback, guiding them towards the correct answer. If the guessed number matches the randomly generated target, a lively "Congratulations" message with a green blinking effect appears, accompanied by the player's score. Conversely, for incorrect guesses, a red message prompts players to try again while displaying the correct direction to the target numberâ€”whether it is greater or lesser. With an intuitive interface and immediate feedback, this game offers an enjoyable experience for individuals seeking a fun and educational way to engage with numerical challenges.

The development of the "Guess The Number" game involved creating a structured plan using pseudocode, a high-level description of the program's logic before actual coding. In the pseudocode, the algorithm for generating a random target number, receiving user input, and providing feedback was outlined. It detailed the conditional statements for congratulating or guiding the player based on their guess. This planning phase helped in organizing the game's logic and ensured a systematic development process. Subsequently, the pseudocode was translated into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to bring the game to life. This step-by-step approach facilitated the creation of a smooth and interactive user experience, combining logical planning with practical implementation.
